		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
			The journey to Software Development started with an interest of taking a look under the hood of my laptop. It was revitalizing, to understand what works, and how it works but it brought forth a greater hunger the need to understand programs and software. Today, I strive to learn more about programming, to read more on the changes in the technological world, and to practice harder to be a change agent within my community. <br>
            I am a tech-enthusiast working towards being a Full Stack Developer. I am fascinated by how front-end development works and intrigued even more by the back-end development end of creating software. Learning and re-learning the inner works of development has pushed me beyond limits I thought I couldn't reach. It has helped revolutionize, my world, to a world of 0 and 1s, that I am chasing daily trying to seek a deeper understanding of software. <br>
            Development is at the core of change, as most developers take a try at solving world issues. As an african, I know that I have the ability to chnage my continent, through creation of software that is tailored for our needs. I am an enthusiastic writer and programmer who seeks to understand the varioius dimensions that exist in the continent and how as a race we can come together for the sake of Africa. <br>
